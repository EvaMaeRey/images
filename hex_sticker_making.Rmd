# Welcome!

This is a 'the-making-of' type flipbook.  We'll see how the *animated* {flipbookr}  hex sticker is made with {ggplot2} and [{magick}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magick/vignettes/intro.html), a great image manipulation package.  

--

As I'm writing this welcome, the animated hex sticker isn't fully put together -- the animation bit is yet to come, but I'm confident we can get it done (maybe with a for loop - that's the quick way for me - you might find it ugly).  

--

The idea is to put a series of images inside the hex, and present as a gif.

# Warm up: using {magick} to prepare background image for these slides

--

For this flipbook, I wanted to try to use the cover image throughout the entire slide deck, but a washed out version.  Lore Abad and collaborators do this in their [spatial networks slides](https://sfnetworks.github.io/sfnetworks-webinar/slides#1) and they look fantastic.  They use [xaringanthemer]() to do so. 

--

Having a image background is actually helpful to demonstrate what's transparent in images and what's not.  

--

Let's look at the preparation of this background image which will give you a feel for how to get things done with {magick}.

magick::image_read(honey_comb) %>% 
  magick::image_colorize(opacity = 90, 
                         color = "snow1") %>% 
  magick::image_write(path = "background.png")

# Building a hex *frame* only with ggplot2

I'm not sure that I will use this, but maybe.

`r chunk_reveal("build_hex_frame")`


```{r build_hex_frame, include = F}

# Build the contents of the hex sticker

We'll put a ggplot build created with flipbookr inside the hex sticker.

`r chunk_reveal("cars_flipbook")`

# the static hex sticker

Now let's have a look at the static hex sticker that Britt Woodrum created.  Someone at the RStudio conference suggested that instead of hex stickers, I should create hex pads of paper! Great idea, a bit ambitious.  But that was a source of inspiration.

Britt pushed for hex branding after watching the ["The development of 'datos' package for the R4DS Spanish translation"](https://rstudio.com/resources/rstudioconf-2020/the-development-of-datos-package-for-the-r4ds-spanish-translation/).  The creators of "datos" prioritzed the hex sticker!

Britt worked on several version and we've kind of settled on this one.  I love what Britt created!  Colors were inspired by the RLadies Xaringan theme - which I used pretty consistently in the early flipbooks.  Emi Tanaka's pick really.

`r chunk_reveal("britt")`

```{r britt, include=F}
magick::image_read("flipbook_sticker_britt.png") %>% 
  magick::image_rotate(10) %>% 
  magick::image_rotate(-20) %>% 
  magick::image_rotate(20) ->
  rotated

magick::image_read("flipbook_sticker_britt.png")
```
